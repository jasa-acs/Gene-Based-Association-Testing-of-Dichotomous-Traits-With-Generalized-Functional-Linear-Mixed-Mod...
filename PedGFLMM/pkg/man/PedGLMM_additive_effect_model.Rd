\usage{
PedGLMM_additive_effect_model(
  ped,
  geno,
  covariate = NULL,
  optimizer = "bobyqa",
  Wald = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{A data frame containing the pedigree information with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{ID}{Person ID}
  \item{ped}{pedigree ID,character or numeric allowed.}
  \item{person}{person ID, a unique ID within each pedigree, numeric or character allowed.}
  \item{father}{father ID, NA if no father.}
  \item{mother}{mother ID,  NA if no mother.}
  \item{sex}{sex, coded as 1 for male, 2 for female.}
  \item{trait}{trait phenotype, case-control status coded as 1 for affected and 0 for unaffected. Subjects with missing (NA) will be removed from the analysis.}
}}

\item{geno}{A data frame containing the genotype information.  This is a matrix with genotypes for subjects (rows) at each variant position (columns). The first two columns are required to be named “ped” and “person”, which are used to match subjects to their data in the pedigree data.frame. The genotypes are coded as 0, 1, 2 for autosomal markers (typically a count of the number of the minor alleles).}

\item{covariate}{A data frame containing the covariate information. The first two columns are required to be named “ped” and “person”, which are used to match subjects to their data in the pedigree data frame. This is optional and the default "covariate = NULL" is for the case when the covariate matrix is not provided.}

\item{optimizer}{Optimizer to use (default = "bobyqa").}

\item{Wald}{If Wald is set to true, return the Wald p-value in addition to the LRT p-value (Default: Wald = FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
  \item{LRT}{The p-value based on a likelihood ratio test}
  \item{Wald}{The p-value based on a Wald test, returned if 'Wald' is TRUE}
  \item{nbetabasis}{The number of basis functions used to estimate the genetic effect function}
  \item{ngenobasis}{The number of basis functions used to estimate the genetic variant functions}
  \item{M_gao}{The effective number of variants in the region, as computed by M_GAO function}
}
